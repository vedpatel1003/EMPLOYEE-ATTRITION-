Employee Attrition Prediction - Python Script
This script utilizes machine learning to predict employee attrition based on the "WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv" dataset.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
Instructions:

Install Libraries: Ensure you have the required libraries installed using pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn.
Place Dataset: Place the "WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv" file in the same directory as this script (script.py).
Run the Script: Execute the script from your terminal using python script.py.
Output:

The script generates various visualizations and performance metrics, including:
Distribution of employee attrition.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) plots to understand relationships between features and attrition.
Accuracy score of a Random Forest model for attrition prediction.
Feature importance analysis to identify the most influential factors for the model.
Cross-validation scores for a more robust evaluation of model generalizability.
Additional Information:

This script provides a basic framework for employee attrition prediction.
The feature selection and hyperparameter tuning stages can be further optimized based on your analysis and desired outcomes.
Consider incorporating additional data sources or techniques like feature engineering for potentially better model performance.
Disclaimer:

The provided dataset may not be entirely representative of a real-world employee population. The results and recommendations should be interpreted with this limitation in mind.
